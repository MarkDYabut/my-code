> "In life we're always bumping into new problems, and while we have the desire to solve them, it's often hard to find the right solution or even know where to start." <br /> - InVision

A typical design process, one used in the tech industry for planning solutions for a given problem is broken down into five stages:

1. Understand
2. Brainstorm
3. Refine
4. Prototype
5. Feedback

The idea is more of a philosophy then a set guideline to follow. Depending on your current state, you are able to skip steps and go backwards or forwards. The key is to realize that it is an iterative process, and to focus on getting a better solution.

## Step 1: Understand

Understand is to...

- Figure out the problem
- Research the source
- Explore different perspectives
- Put yourself is someone else's shoes

The goal of the understanding phase is to define the problem as if you were the one who had the problem. Luckily if it is yourself that has the problem that needs solving, it'll be very easy to define it.

## Step 2: Brainstorm

Brainstorm is to...

- Ideate
- Compute up with solutions
- Focus on quantity

The goal of the brainstorming phase is to come up with as many ideas as possible. To focus on quantity, because you're not constrained to using them all â†’ the idea is to remove all restrictions on your thinking.

## Step 3: Refine

Refine is to...

- Connect your ideas
- Pick the ideas that make sense
- Focus on the best solutions

The goal of the refining phase is to relate all your ideas together, and come up with a solution to try.

## Step 4: Prototype

Prototype is to...

- Execute
- Get that first draft out
- Test

The goal of the prototyping phase is to test your solution, and get as much feedback on it as possible.

## Step 5: Feedback

Feedback is to...

- Receive criticism
- Find out what didn't work
- Find out what worked

The goal of the feedback phase is to improve your solution based on another perspective.

## Iterate!

From here you can jump back to any of the other steps, and then continue the process. The beauty of having an iterative design process for problem solving is that it always allows for improvement, and when we're using it for our own problem's of life we are usually not constrained by deadlines. You can think of your solutions to your problems as eternally changing and improving.
